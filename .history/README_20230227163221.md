Regex is a short word for regular expressions.Regular expressions are a terms used by the computer to help people understand computer language.

## Summary

We are going to explore regex in javascript. Regex is a way to match certain expressions in a string. We are going to see how to code and implement Regex in the code and check it.

## Regex Components

Regex has the following Components.
        -characters 
        -expressions
        -anchors
        -quantifiers

### Anchors


### Quantifiers

### Grouping Constructs

### Bracket Expressions

A bracket expression represents a character set through a list of characters enclosed by the square brackets: '[' and ']'. It normally matches the target string with any single character from the list.

If the character list begins with '^', it matches any single character not from the rest of the list.
If two characters in the list are separated by '–', this is shorthand for the (inclusive) range of characters between those two. It is illegal for two ranges to share an endpoint, e.g. a-c-e. Ranges are collating-sequence dependent and should be avoided for portability.

Most special characters lose their special status and become literals within brackets. Additionally,

    – is literal at the end or beginning of a bracket expression
    ^ is literal if not at the beginning of a bracket expression

### Character Classes
 
  A single character with no special significance represents that character in the target string. The characters with special significance (i.e. operator characters) are these:

^ . [ $ ( ) | * + ? { \

A non-alphanumeric character acts as the literal character (whether special or not) by escaping it, namely, adding \ in front of it.
Wild card. The . (period) special character matches any single character except \n (newline).

A backslash,\, followed by one of the characters a, b, f, n, r, t, v represents the ANSI-C interpretation of the control character

### The OR Operator

### Flags

### Character Escapes

These are special sequences representing commonly used character sets:

    \w is word (program identifier) character: [A-Za-z0-9_]
    \W is non-word character: [^A-Za-z0-9_]
    \s is a whitespace character: [ \f\n\r\t]
    \S is a non-whitespace character: [^ \f\n\r\t]
    \d is a digit character: [0-9]
    \D is a non-digit character: [^0-9]
