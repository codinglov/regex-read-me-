## Regex Components

A regex must be wrapped in slash characters (/). We are going to learn how to learn how to find a url in regex ie.-Matching a URL: `/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`

### Anchors

These match invisible positions before and after the characters in a string.
These include  
            -\b - word boundary
            -\B - Not a word boundary
            - ^ - beginning of a string
            - $ - end of string



### Quantifiers

Helps match more than one character at a time.they include :
        - * - 0 or more
        - + - 1 or more
        - ? - 0 or one
        - {3} - Exact numbers
        - {3,4}- Range of numbers (minimum, maximum)
      

        
### Grouping Constructs

These allow us to match several different patterns . Groups are created using parenthesis (). Examples include: - to find mr,mrs and mr we could say M(r|s|rs)

### Bracket Expressions

These are special character sets in square brackets that look for specific (only characters that are in the brackets ) character matches. Examples include :
         -[a-z] looks for all lowercase letters from a to z
         -[A-Z] looks for all uppercase letters from A_Z
         -[\d]  looks for all numbers in the string
         -[^] means not included in the search match
         
Bracket expressions are also known as positive or inclusive expressions because they include everything in the brackets.    


### Character Classes

These defines a set of characters that occur in an input string to fulfill a match.
Examples include:
            -. matches any character except the newline character(\n)
            -\d matches any arabic numeral digit. It is equivalent to the bracket expression [0-9].
            -\w Matches any alphanumeric character from the basic Latin alphabet, including(_) . Also the same as bracket expression [A-Za-z0-9_].
            -/s matches a single whitespace character including tabs and line breaks.
            -\D matches all nun-digit characters.


### The OR Operator

the OR character 
### Flags

Flags are the only exception to the regex components rule. These special characters are placed at the end of a regex after the second slash they define additional functionality or limits for the regex.
Examples include:
  -g : Global search: means regex should be tested against all possible matches in a string.
  -i : Case insensitive search: case should be ignored while attempting a match in a string.
  -m : Multiline search: a multi-line input string should be treated as multiple lines.


### Character Escapes

These special characters "escape" characters that would otherwise have been interpreted literally.These are mostly used when the string has characters matching the regex Components.
Examples include :-,\, character
